# Basic components

## Core

Testing base classes and their built-in overloading which do not require any modelling (i.e. epigraphs, integer models or callbacks)

## Operators

Testing more advanced overloading and added operators which require modelling strategies (i.e. epigraphs, integer models or callbacks)
